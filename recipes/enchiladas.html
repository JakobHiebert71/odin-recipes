    <h4>This Tex-Mex-inspired beef enchilada recipe is richly seasoned, easy to make, and always such a crowd fave!</h4>

    <p>One of my longtime favorite recipes to whip up for a big dinner party, wrap up in a casserole dish to bring to friends, or bake up on a regular old weeknight here with just the three of us — say hello to my favorite beef enchiladas!</p>

    <p>These delicious Tex-Mex-inspired enchiladas are loaded up with with tender ground beef (or we often make ours nowadays with plant-based meat), green chiles, onion, garlic, beans, cheese, your choice of tortillas, and my favorite red enchilada sauce. And when baked to warm and melty perfection, then served up with a few slices of avocado and perhaps a sprinkling of fresh cilantro and crumbled cotija, I can tell you — after a decade plus of serving these enchiladas to loved ones — that they are always, always such a hit.</p>
        
    <p>They're perfect for prepping ahead of time, making this recipe a great option for easy entertaining or popping in the oven after a long day of work. And they can also easily be made gluten-free with corn tortillas and my homemade sauce, if you'd like.</p>
        
    <p>I've made this beef enchiladas recipe more times than I can count and know we'll certainly be enjoying it in our house for many years to come. So if you have yet to give it a try, it's time!</p>

        <li>1 batch red enchilada sauce (or 15 ounce store-bought red enchilada sauce)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small white onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) can pinto beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 (4-ounce) can diced green chiles</li>
        <li>fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>8 large flour tortillas</li>
        <li>3 cup Mexican-blend shredded cheese</li>
        <li>Toppings: fresh cilantro, chopped red onions, diced avocado, sour cream, and/or crumbled cotija cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the enchilada sauce. Prepare the enchilada sauce according to <a href="https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/red-enchilada-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> instructions.</a></li>
        <li>Sauté the beef filling. Heat oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the ground beef and cumin and sauté for 5 minutes or until completely browned, crumbling the beef with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Stir in the beans and green chiles until combined. Season the mixture with a few generous pinches of salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
        <li>Prep oven and baking dish. Heat oven to 350°F (180°C). Spread 1/2 cup of the enchilada sauce evenly along the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Assemble the enchiladas. To assemble the enchiladas, set up an assembly line including: tortillas, enchilada sauce, beef filling, and cheese. Lay out a tortilla, and spread two tablespoons of sauce over the surface of the tortilla. Add a generous spoonful of the beef filling in a line down the center of the tortilla, then sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheese. Roll up the tortilla and place it in the prepared baking dish. Assemble the remaining enchiladas. Spread any remaining sauce evenly over the top of the enchiladas, followed by any extra cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes, or until the enchiladas are cooked through and the tortillas are slightly crispy on the outside. Transfer the baking dish to a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Serve. Serve the enchiladas immediately while they're nice and hot, garnished with lots of your favorite toppings. Enjoy!</li>
