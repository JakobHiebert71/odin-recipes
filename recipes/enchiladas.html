    <h4>This Tex-Mex-inspired beef enchilada recipe is richly seasoned, easy to make, and always such a crowd fave!</h4>

    <p>One of my longtime favorite recipes to whip up for a big dinner party, wrap up in a casserole dish to bring to friends, or bake up on a regular old weeknight here with just the three of us — say hello to my favorite beef enchiladas!</p>

    <p>These delicious Tex-Mex-inspired enchiladas are loaded up with with tender ground beef (or we often make ours nowadays with plant-based meat), green chiles, onion, garlic, beans, cheese, your choice of tortillas, and my favorite red enchilada sauce. And when baked to warm and melty perfection, then served up with a few slices of avocado and perhaps a sprinkling of fresh cilantro and crumbled cotija, I can tell you — after a decade plus of serving these enchiladas to loved ones — that they are always, always such a hit.</p>
        
    <p>They're perfect for prepping ahead of time, making this recipe a great option for easy entertaining or popping in the oven after a long day of work. And they can also easily be made gluten-free with corn tortillas and my homemade sauce, if you'd like.</p>
        
    <p>I've made this beef enchiladas recipe more times than I can count and know we'll certainly be enjoying it in our house for many years to come. So if you have yet to give it a try, it's time!</p>
