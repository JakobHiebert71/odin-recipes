    <h4>This crispy baked Parmesan crusted chicken is juicy on the inside with a crunchy coating of butter, panko breadcrumbs, parmesan and parsley. Serve them with some veggies, a salad, or over a bed of pasta.</h4>
   
    <p>Chicken is the perfect protein canvas. I goes with everything. The flavor was never the problem; I had to conquer all thatâ€¦ flesh. And I did. In two simple and effective steps - first, flay it; and second, pound the crap out of it. (Sounds violent, but I was really hating on chicken at the time.) This breast-to-cutlet beatdown cured my burnout for good. Especially with this recipe for chicken with parmesan.</p>

    <p>Baked parmesan crusted chicken breast is one of the easiest, crowd-pleasiest preparations out there, as long as you prep it properly. It's not hard at all and it guarantees perfectly, evenly cooked (i.e. moist on the inside, and crunchy, but never burned, on the outside) parmesan chicken</p>
